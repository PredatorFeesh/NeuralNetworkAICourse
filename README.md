# Neural Network for AI Course

## What are we doing?
We are following the tutorial found [here](https://medium.com/binaryandmore/beginners-guide-to-deriving-and-implementing-backpropagation-e3c1a5a1e536) about a basic introduction to Neural Networks in Python3. Our goal is to
- Modify the code to accept CIFAR-10 data
- Re-implement the code in C++
- And ideally include SSE Optimizations, to speed it up even more.

## Why are we doing this?
This is both a learning experience for us, and a chance to apply optimizations to make this algorithm run even faster.

## Credit
We are basing everything initial off of [Pranav Budhwant's article](https://medium.com/binaryandmore/beginners-guide-to-deriving-and-implementing-backpropagation-e3c1a5a1e536) on neural networks. The original repository can be found [here](https://github.com/pranavbudhwant/backpropagation-in-numpy).
